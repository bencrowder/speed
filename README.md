## Speed

A writing tool, using time and word count goals. Written using [Electron](http://electron.atom.io).


### Usage

Follow Electron's [application distribution instructions](http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.37.3/tutorial/application-distribution/) to create a usable binary. For OS X, a default app icon (`icons/Speed.icns`) has been included, though it will need to be copied to the appropriate directory before it will work.


### Keyboard shortcuts

- Shift+Enter will pause/resume the timer.
